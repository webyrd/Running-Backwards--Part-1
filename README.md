Running-Backwards--Part-1
========================================

** I have stopped making this series, at least for now.  Please see the newer 'miniKanren-uncourse' instead: https://github.com/webyrd/miniKanren-uncourse.

Complete code from episode 1 of my 'Running Backwards' videos on
relational programming:

----------------------------------------

All files are written in Scheme, and have been tested under Vicare Scheme.

----------------------------------------

The files:

``transcript.scm`` contains the transcript of the editing session from
the video.

``evalo.scm`` contains the relational evaluator, which uses the helper
definitions in ``interp-helpers.scm`` and ``mk.scm``
